# Pudel

## Motivation

The inspiration behind Pudel's creation stems from the discontinuation of the highly regarded Eli bot, developed by a talented developer. Recognizing the need for a replacement, Pudel was conceived to carry on the legacy of Eli, ensuring users could continue to enjoy a similar chatbot experience.

## Features

- Discord Integration: Pudel seamlessly integrates with Discord, allowing users to interact with the bot through the platform.
- Natural Language Processing: Incorporating NLP libraries like Apache OpenNLP, Pudel enhances its understanding of user queries, enabling effective processing and interpretation.
- Familiarity and Continuity: Pudel's goal is to capture the style and mannerisms established by Eli, providing users with a sense of familiarity and continuity.
- Reliable and Enjoyable: Pudel strives to deliver a reliable and enjoyable chatbot experience, ensuring users have a seamless transition from Eli to Pudel.
